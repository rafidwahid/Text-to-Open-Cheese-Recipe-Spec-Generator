okay so today we're making a basic cheddar cheese. I've got two gallons of whole cow's milk here. First thing we do is heat it up to about 86 degrees fahrenheit, that's around 30 celsius. Once we're there I'm adding in my mesophilic culture, about a quarter teaspoon, and letting that ripen for 45 minutes. The pH should be around 6.5 at this point. Now I'm adding half a teaspoon of liquid rennet diluted in a quarter cup of water. We let that set for about 45 minutes until we get a clean break. Cut the curds into half inch cubes. Now we slowly heat to 100°F over about 30 minutes, stirring gently. Once we're at temp we hold it there for another 30 minutes. Drain the whey when pH hits about 5.8. Now we're cheddaring - stacking the curd slabs and flipping every 15 minutes until pH reaches 5.4. Mill the curds and add 2 tablespoons of cheese salt. Press at 20 pounds for 1 hour, then 40 pounds overnight. Age at 55°F and 85% humidity for at least 3 months, up to 12 months for a sharper flavor.
